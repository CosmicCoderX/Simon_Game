This is a modern, browser-based version of the **Simon Memory Game** featuring glowing quadrant buttons, sound effects, and a responsive, arcade-style design.

The game challenges your memory by playing increasingly long sequences of colors that you must repeat in the same order. It’s built with a **sleek circular layout** inspired by the original toy and enhanced with a glowing interface and smooth animations for an immersive, retro-futuristic experience.

## 🧠 How to Play

1. **Start the Game**  
   Press any key to begin.

2. **Watch the Sequence**  
   A colored button will flash and play a tone. Remember the order.

3. **Repeat the Sequence**  
   Click the buttons in the exact same order as shown.

4. **Progression**  
   Each level adds one more color to the sequence. It gets harder the longer you last!

5. **Game Over**  
   If you click the wrong button, the game ends. You'll hear a “wrong” sound and see a red flash.  
   Press any key to restart the game.
